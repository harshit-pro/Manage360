# Chanakya Library Platform – Product Vision

## What is this product?
Chanakya Library Platform is a multi-tenant SaaS system that helps
study library owners manage students, seats, memberships, and fees
through a centralized admin dashboard.

## Who uses it?
- Study library owners
- Library staff (optional, limited access)

## What problem does it solve?
Library owners currently manage students and fees using manual
registers or spreadsheets, which leads to errors, poor visibility,
and time waste.

## Core value
- Digital student & seat management
- Automated membership tracking
- Fee collection & pending fee insights
- Clear dashboards and reports

## What it is NOT
- Not a book library system
- Not a student-facing app (admin-only)
